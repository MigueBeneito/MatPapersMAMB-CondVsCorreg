# Supplementary on-line material for the paper: 'Some links between conditional and coregionalized multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields'

This page hosts the supplementary online material for the paper: 'Some links between conditional and coregionalized multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields' by Miguel A. Martinez-Beneito. 

The `.pdf` file contains every R code detail that you could find of interest in regard to the example in the paper. Nevertheless, if you wanted to reproduce the example (with slightly modified data) by yourself we suggest you to download all the material in the repository, open the `.Rproj` file from Rstudio and try to compile (knit) the Rmarkdown document `Rcode.Rmd`.

Hope you find this useful.

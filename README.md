# Supplementary on-line material for the paper: 'Some links between conditional and coregionalized multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields'

This page hosts the supplementary online material for the paper: 'Some links between conditional and coregionalized multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields' by Miguel A. Martinez-Beneito. 

The `.pdf` file contains the full `R` code used for executing the example in the paper. Nevertheless, if you wanted to reproduce the example by yourself (with slightly modified data), we suggest you to download all the material in this repository, open the `.Rproj` file from Rstudio and try to compile (knit) the Rmarkdown document `Rcode.Rmd`.

Hope you find this useful.
